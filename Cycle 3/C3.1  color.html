<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the core language of the world wide web and is used to define the structure and layout of web documents by using various tags and attributes. Although a fundamental language of the web, HTML is a static language - content created with it does not change. HTML is used to specify the way webpages look, not how they function.</p>
