<h1><u>KOTTAYAM</u></h1>	
<h3>HISTORY</h3>
<p>The name Kottayam is a combination of the words "kotta" and "akam" in the local language of Malayalam, meaning "interior of a fort".
The current Kottayam district was previously part of the state of Travancore. Earlier, the Travancore state consisted of two revenue divisions: the southern and northern divisions, both under the administrative control of a "Diwan Peshkar" for each. Later in 1868, two more divisions—Kollam and Kottayam—were constituted. A fifth division Devikulam was added, but it only lasted for a short period, and was then joined with Kottayam. At the time of the integration of the state of Travancore and Kochi in 1949, these revenue divisions were renamed as districts and the Diwan Peshkars gave way to district collectors, paving the way for the birth of the Kottayam district in July 1949. The cities included were Kottayam, Muvattupuzha (including present-day Kothamangalam), Thodupuzha, Changanasserry, Vaikkom, Meenachil, Devikulam and Peermade taluks.</p>

<P>
Illikkal Kallu is a monolith located on top of the Illickal Malaa in the Kottayam district of Kerala, India.The distance from kottayam railway station to illikal kallu is 57km. Situated at around 3400 feet above sea level, Illickal Kallu is a major tourist attraction in Moonnilavu and Thalanadu village of Meenachil taluk. Only one half of the original rock remains, as the other half of the rock has fallen off. The nearest town is Teekoy. Numerous mountain streams originate from this peak and flow down to form the Meenachil River. Tourists must trek <1 km to reach the summit of the peak.Illikkal Mala comprises three hills, each rising up to 3,400 ft above sea level. Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known as Kuda Kallu (umbrella-shaped rock). The second hill has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunch back rock). There is a ​1⁄2-foot-wide bridge called Narakapalam (bridge to hell) connecting these two hills.
